One thing [people](https://feedback.unity3d.com/suggestions/editor-camera-fov-adjustable) [repeatedly say](https://feedback.unity3d.com/suggestions/scene-view-camera-field-of-view-adjustment) is missing in Unity Editor's Scene View is that there is no way to control the Field of View (FoV).
With this extension, you will now be able to do this using the Unity Editor's private API.


## How to use
|Keyboard/Mouse					|Effect							|Note			|
|--------------------				|-------------------------				|----			|
|`FoV` button in the toolbar of Scene View	|Toggle FoV mode (auto / manual)			|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Wheel				|Changes FoV						|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Wheel			|Changes FoV (high speed)				|Unavailable on Mac	|
|Ctrl + Alt + O					|Increases FoV (wide angle)				|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + P					|Reduces FoV (narrow angle/telescopic)			|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Shift + O				|Increases FoV (high speed, wide angle)			|			|
|Ctrl + Alt + Shift + P				|Reduces FoV (high speed, narrow angle/telescopic)	|			|

You can also right click the `FoV` button to use the following functionalities

|Menu name					|Effect						|Note							|
|--------------------				|-------------------------			|----							|
|FoV : Auto (Default behaviour)			|Set FoV mode to "Auto"				|"Auto" means Unity Editor's normal behaviour		|
